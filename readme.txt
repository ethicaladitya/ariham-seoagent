Autonomous SEO agent that connects Google Search Console and GA4, surfaces post-level opportunities, and proposes safe, reversible metadata fixes.

== Description ==

SEO Agent AI continuously analyzes your blog using Google Search Console and Google Analytics 4 data, scores each post for SEO opportunities, and proposes prioritized recommendations.

Where it adds value:

* Pulls real Search Console queries, impressions, clicks, CTR, and average position per post.
* Pulls GA4 sessions, engagement rate, and average time-on-page per post.
* Detects six SEO signals per post: missing meta basics, title/meta optimization opportunity, thin content, content refresh needed, intent mismatch, and declining performance.
* Builds prioritized recommendations with confidence scores and a clear "safe vs risky" classification.
* Optional Gemini AI integration to generate keyword-rich meta titles, meta descriptions, and focus-keyword suggestions.
* Writes meta updates to all detected SEO plugins (Yoast, RankMath, SmartCrawl, The SEO Framework) plus the plugin's own meta keys.
* Every change is recorded in an activity log table with full before/after, signals, and confidence — and is one-click reversible.
* Optional autopilot mode applies only safe recommendations above a confidence floor, capped at a configurable daily limit.

This plugin makes no remote calls until you connect a Google account and provide an OAuth client ID and secret. The Gemini integration is fully optional and is gated on a user-supplied API key.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `seo-agent-ai` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install via the WordPress plugin browser.
2. Activate SEO Agent AI from the Plugins screen.
3. Open SEO Agent AI → Settings and enter your Google OAuth Client ID + Client Secret. (Create a project at https://console.cloud.google.com/, enable the Search Console API and the Google Analytics Data API, and add the wp-admin URL of your "Connect Google" page as an authorized redirect URI.)
4. Open SEO Agent AI → Connect Google and complete the OAuth flow.
5. In Settings, pick your verified Search Console property and your GA4 property.
6. Optionally paste a Gemini API key to enable AI-powered meta-title and description generation.
7. Click "Run Analysis Now" once to seed the data; daily WP-Cron will keep it fresh.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin auto-publish changes to my live posts? =

No. Default mode is recommendation-only. You must click "Approve & Apply" on each safe recommendation. Autopilot mode is opt-in, applies only "safe" classifications above your confidence floor, and is capped to a daily limit you set.

= Does it call any external service before I configure it? =

No. The plugin makes no remote calls until you supply OAuth credentials and connect a Google account. The optional Gemini integration is only invoked when you save an API key.

= Where are my OAuth tokens stored? =

In the WordPress options table, encrypted with AES-256-CBC using a key derived from your `wp_salt('secure_auth')`. Refresh tokens, access tokens, and (since v2.1.0) the Gemini API key are all encrypted at rest.

= Which SEO plugins does it write to? =

Yoast SEO, RankMath, SmartCrawl, and The SEO Framework — all that are detected as active. The plugin also stores its own copy in dedicated post-meta keys, so you keep your data even if you swap SEO plugins later.

= How do I roll back a change? =

Open SEO Agent AI → Activity Report, find the entry, click Rollback. The previous value is restored across every SEO plugin meta key that was originally written.

= Will the plugin uninstall cleanly? =

Yes. Uninstalling removes the activity log table, every plugin option, every plugin post-meta key, all transients, and unschedules the cron event.

== External Services ==

This plugin connects to third-party services **only after you provide credentials and authorize the connection**. No external call is made on plugin activation.

**Google APIs (mandatory for core functionality)**
When you complete the Google OAuth flow, the plugin communicates with:
- `accounts.google.com` — OAuth 2.0 authorization and token exchange
- `oauth2.googleapis.com` — Access-token refresh
- `searchconsole.googleapis.com` — Fetching Search Console query data, impressions, clicks, and ranking positions for your verified property
- `analyticsdata.googleapis.com` — Fetching GA4 sessions, engagement rate, and time-on-page
- `analyticsadmin.googleapis.com` — Listing available GA4 properties
- Privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy | Terms: https://policies.google.com/terms

**Gemini AI (optional)**
When you save a Gemini API key in Settings, AI-generated meta titles and descriptions are fetched from:
- `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
- Privacy policy: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms

**OpenAI-compatible endpoint (optional)**
When you configure an API key and base URL for an OpenAI-compatible provider (defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1`), AI meta suggestions are fetched from your configured endpoint. This could be the standard OpenAI endpoint or any compatible alternative you specify.
- OpenAI privacy policy: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy | Terms: https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use

No data is sent to any service until you explicitly configure and connect it.
